					<h1>Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Dashboard Builder</h1>
					<h3>Exago BI</h3>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<p>
						When you think of business intelligence (BI) and data analytics the first thing that likely comes to mind is a beautiful Dashboard. What isn’t thought of is the knowledge and work required to create this effortless-looking display of key metrics and charts. <span class="noteable">Exago’s Dashboard creation experience is outdated, confusing, and frustrating to use; overall a weak point for Exago in the competitive data analytics market.</span>
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Some competitors in the space are solely focused on Dashboards, and therefore often outshine Exago. Exago doesn't just focus on Dashboards, but it is still an important feature for customers and the sales team was losing deals because of it. 
					</p>
					<br/>

					<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

				<h2>Consolidate and Simplify Filters</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>Four different filters mattered on a technical level, but from the user's perspective effectively did the same thing: limit data on the Dashboard. 
				<br/>
				I consolidated the filters and used consistent styling to convey a simple mental model. I also used progressive disclosure to hide options and information not immediately important. I instead highlighted and answered the three most pertinent questions at this point in the workflow:

Almost everyone gave up trying to learn the information architecture and instead would click every section until they stumbled upon whatever they were looking for.

				<h2>Exago's First Usability Testing Session</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Seeing is believing. With no allotted time for UX research, I made time for moderated usability testing. <span class="noteable">I chose this method because I was able to gather task completion metrics and ask specific questions in addition to testing the proposed solution.</span></p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Here is a short snippet from one usability testing session:
				</p>
				<br/>
				<video width="100%" controls muted>
					<source src="assets/UsabilityTestPrototype_Caption.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					<source src="assets/UsabilityTestPrototype_Caption.ogg" type="video/ogg">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Asking the right questions at the right time is the hardest part of usability testing. I caught myself asking leading questions, missing opportunities to ask questions, and speaking when I should have been quiet.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Oftentimes I didn’t dig into questions enough. I would ask something like “Why did you decide to click on X?”  with a response like “I was looking for a way to change Y.” I would stop there, instead of continuing down the line of questioning with “How are you trying to change that?”
				</p>

				<h2>Visual Design</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Customers embed the software into their products, so the style needs to feel <span class="noteable">neutral</span> and blend in. Secondly, the interface needs to be as simple and <span class="noteable">minimal</span> as possible because the powerful solution can be easily overwhelming. Finally, I made a point to design <span class="noteable">accessible</span> elements like labels, bigger text, and contrasting colors that pass WCAG standards.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Learnings</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The marketing team's graphic designer collaborated with me in design sessions, greatly helping me improve my UI design skills. I learned to spend more time zoomed in to refine the small details as well as zoom out to the overall personality and make sure it is cohesive.

				<h2>Outcomes</h2>
				<br/>
				<p>
					The long-term goals for the Dashboard Builder are to improve the overall user experience and contend better against competitors. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In one word, the experience was untrustworthy. Certain areas were difficult to navigate, confusing, and users would get unexpected results. On top of this, the application was sometimes buggy and slow, causing a lot of frustration (not something that ended up affecting my decisions but did affect the overall project scope).
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Post-project, some indicators pointed out that we had improved these areas. 
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I did a round of usability testing with coworkers at the end of the project. Task completion rates improved and people found the options they were looking for at a much faster rate compared to usability testing conducted before the project.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					We have received positive sentiment from customers and potential buyers regarding Dashboards; including more G2 Crowd reviews as well as one industry expert comparing Exago to a competitor tool claiming, "Exago Dashboards are much more intuitive and easy to use."
					<br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to the project's successes, the team held a retrospective meeting to discuss learnings from the project. We collectively agreed to introduce more testing in the future - a huge win. I proved the value of usability testing and have since been given more room for research. I have also heard other team members suggest testing to answer some design questions.
